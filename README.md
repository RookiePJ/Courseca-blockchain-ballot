# Courseca Blockchain Ballot

DApp code from the Coursesa tutorial "Decentralised Applications (Dapps)"

Original code from the course will not compile or deploy in the lastest version of truffle, therefore the code here will work for a newer version - as of April 2020.   

Truffle v5.0.31 (core: 5.0.31)
Solidity v0.5.0 (solc-js)
Node v8.15.0
Web3.js v1.2.1
